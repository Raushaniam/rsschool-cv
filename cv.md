# __About me:__
I have been working as a lawyer for 2 years, I found that I was not interested in my work because there was a lot of routine tasks that was related with writing documents by templates and I did not see any growth prospects in this area. I was looking for a promising area where I could work from home and be part of a large company. I quit my job as a lawyer and began to study HTML and CSS on my own.

My goal is studying Front-End Development and moving over to Software Engineering scene. It will be difficult for me to master a new profession, but my friendliness, responsiveness, perseverance and patience will help me.

# __Skills__
Beginner level: HTML&CSS, JavaScript, GitHub, TypeScript, React.

# __Code examples:__
```
function likes(names) {
 let a = names.length;
 let text = '';
 let number = names.length - 2;
     if(a===0) {
         text = "no one likes this";
     } else if (a===1) {
         text = `${names[0]} likes this`; 
     } else if (a===2) {
         text = `${names[0]} and ${names[1]} like this`; 
     } else if (a===3) {
         text = `${names[0]}, ${names[1]} and ${names[2]} like this`;
     } else if (a>=4) {
         text = `${names[0]}, ${names[1]} and ${number} others like this`;
     }
 return text;
}
```
